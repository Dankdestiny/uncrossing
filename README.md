# Uncrossing
A puzzle game where a planar network is generated, and the position of the nodes randomized so that the edges of the network are crossing.
The objective is the drag the nodes to uncross the edges, hence the name. Once all lines are uncrossed, pressing space will generate a harder puzzle.
