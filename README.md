# Uncrossing
A puzzle game where a planar network is generated, and the position of the nodes randomized so that the edges of the network are crossing.
The objective is the drag the nodes to uncross the edges, hence the name. Once all lines are uncrossed, pressing space will generate a harder puzzle.
# Tetris
Follows standard Tetris rules. Up rotates a shape, left/right move it accordingly, down makes it fall faster.
upon filling a row the squares in that row are deleted and the score goes up by 1.
The game speeds up as the score increases.
# Connect 4
Same rules as connect 4
# Cube
WASD moves the camera, and clicking+dragging the mouse rotates the camera. Not much more to say, it's just a cube. Just don't get too close or look away because that breaks things.
